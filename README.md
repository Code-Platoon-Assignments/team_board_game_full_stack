# Assignment: Create a Board Game

## Overview

Your task is to create a digital version of one of the following classic board games:

- CandyLand
- Snakes and Ladders
- Monopoly
- Or a board game of your choice

This project should be a fun and collaborative effort, combining your skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and PostgreSQL.

## Team Dynamics

As a team, you'll need to divide yourselves into three main groups:

1. **Front-End Team**:
   - Responsible for creating the user interface of the game.
   - Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the game board, pieces, and other visual elements.

2. **Back-End Team**:
   - Develop the server-side logic using Flask.
   - Manage game state, rules, and interactions.
   - Connect the game to a PostgreSQL database to store any necessary data.

3. **Testing Team**:
   - Ensure that the game functions correctly and is free of bugs.
   - Create test cases for both front-end and back-end components.
   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback and improve the game.

## Project Requirements

- **HTML/CSS**: Create a visually appealing game board and interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implement game logic, animations, and user interactions.
- **Flask**: Develop the server-side application to handle game rules, player moves, and game state.
- **PostgreSQL**: Store game data, such as player scores, game history, and other relevant information.

## Guidelines

- **Simplicity**: Keep the game simple and fun. Focus on core features and functionality.
- **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively within your team and ensure everyone is contributing.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to add unique twists or features to your game to make it stand out.

## Deliverables

- A fully functioning digital board game.
- Documentation on how to run and play the game.
- A presentation showcasing your game, the development process, and any challenges faced.

## Additional Notes

- User authentication is not required for this project.
- Focus on creating a polished and enjoyable game experience.
- Use version control (Git) to manage your codebase and collaboration.

## Conclusion

Have fun with this project and use it as an opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity. Good luck, and enjoy the process of bringing a classic board game to life with your team!
